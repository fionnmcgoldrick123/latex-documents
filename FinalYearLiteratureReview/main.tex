\section{Abstract}
This literature review looks at how Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used in programming education and what that means for students and teachers. Recent studies show that LLMs can explain code, give quick feedback, and help beginners understand difficult concepts in a more accessible way. They can reduce confusion, speed up problem-solving, and make learning feel more personalised. However, the research also points out real challenges. LLMs can produce incorrect answers, students may become too dependent on them, and there are concerns about plagiarism and reduced practice. Some studies report improved understanding when LLMs are used as support tools, while others show little benefit if students rely on them to generate full solutions. Overall, the review suggests that LLMs work best when used to guide and support learning rather than replace actual coding practice. The goal of this paper is to summarise what current research says, highlight the benefits and risks, and point out what still needs to be explored in the future.
