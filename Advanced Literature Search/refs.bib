abstract = {Due to the continuous technology scaling and the ever-increasing complexity and size of the hardware designs, manufacturing defects have become a key obstacle in meeting end-user demand. Despite decades of research, traditional test-generation techniques often struggle to scale to massive and complex designs. Such scalability issues stem from the numerous backtracking the traditional test generation techniques perform before converging to a test pattern. In this work, we present DETECTive that leverages deep learning on graphs to learn fault characteristics and predict test pattern(s) to expose faults without requiring backtracking. DETECTive is trained on small circuits, and its learned knowledge is transferable to predict test patterns for circuits that contain up to 29 \texttimes{} more gates than the training circuits. Since DETECTive avoids backtracking completely, it can predict test patterns up to 15 \texttimes{} faster than academic tools and up to 2 \texttimes{} faster than commercial tools. DETECTive achieves up to 100\% pattern accuracy on synthetic designs and up to 95\% test pattern accuracy on realistic designs. To our knowledge, DETECTive is the first to leverage deep learning to predict test patterns for digital hardware designs that can complement the traditional test generation techniques for faster design closure.},

abstract = {Automated testing for emerging AI-enabled systems is challenging, because data is often highly structured, semantically rich, and continuously evolving. Fuzz testing has been proven to be highly effective; however, it is nontrivial to apply traditional fuzzing to AI systems directly for three reasons: (1) it often fails to bypass format validity checks, which are crucial for testing the core logic of an AI application; (2) it struggles to explore various semantic properties of inputs; and (3) it is incapable of accommodating the latency of AI systems.                                                In this paper, we propose a novel fuzz testing framework specifically for AI systems, called SynGraph. Our approach stands out in two key aspects. First, we utilize graph perturbations to produce syntactically correct data, as opposed to traditional bit-level data manipulation. To achieve this, SynGraph captures the structured information intrinsic to the data and represents it as a graph. Second, we conduct directed mutations that preserve semantic similarity by applying the same mutations to adjacent and similar vertices. SynGraph has been successfully implemented for 5 input modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances testing efficiency.},

abstract = {The increasing complexity of automated and AI-based vehicle systems necessitates novel testing methodologies to ensure safety, reliability, and performance in diverse and dynamic scenarios. This paper introduces AV Test Operating System (ATOS), an open-source platform that seamlessly integrates simulated and physical testing environments for Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems and Automated Driving systems. AV Test Operating System (ATOS) supports comprehensive scenario evaluations under varied conditions such as weather, traffic, and connectivity environments by automating and orchestrating tests involving multiple simultaneous virtual and physical objects. Key contributions of this work include: 1) The introduction and design of AV Test Operating System (ATOS), an open-source platform for automating and orchestrating complex vehicle testing scenarios. 2) A method for evaluating the repeatability of automated test orchestration systems. 3) Data analysis of two scenarios where AV Test Operating System (ATOS) was used in real-life AV testing. Results demonstrate AV Test Operating System (ATOS)’s effectiveness in executing repeatable and reliable tests across diverse configurations, highlighting its utility for research institutions, vehicle manufacturers, and testing facilities. Using AV Test Operating System (ATOS) in repeated runs, the time delay when triggering dynamic events was within 1 millisecond with virtual objects and 7 milliseconds when using physical objects. The positional variation between runs using virtual and real-life objects amounted to 6 and 20 cm, respectively.},
