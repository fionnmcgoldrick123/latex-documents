	abstract = {With the rapid development of computing technology, wearable devices make it easy to get access to people’s health information. Smart healthcare achieves great success by training machine learning models on a large quantity of user personal data. However, there are two critical challenges. First, user data often exist in the form of isolated islands, making it difﬁcult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Second, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this article, we propose FedHealth, the ﬁrst federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated learning, and then builds relatively personalized models by transfer learning. Wearable activity recognition experiments and real Parkinson’s disease auxiliary diagnosis application have evaluated that FedHealth is able to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security. FedHealth is general and extensible in many healthcare applications.},

	abstract = {Several studies underscore the potential of deep learning in identifying complex patterns, leading to diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Identifying sufficiently large and diverse datasets, required for training, is a significant challenge in medicine and can rarely be found in individual institutions. Multi-institutional collaborations based on centrally-shared patient data face privacy and ownership challenges. Federated learning is a novel paradigm for data-private multi-institutional collaborations, where model-learning leverages all available data without sharing data between institutions, by distributing the model-training to the data-owners and aggregating their results. We show that federated learning among 10 institutions results in models reaching 99\% of the model quality achieved with centralized data, and evaluate generalizability on data from institutions outside the federation. We further investigate the effects of data distribution across collaborating institutions on model quality and learning patterns, indicating that increased access to data through data private multi-institutional collaborations can benefit model quality more than the errors introduced by the collaborative method. Finally, we compare with other collaborative-learning approaches demonstrating the superiority of federated learning, and discuss practical implementation considerations. Clinical adoption of federated learning is expected to lead to models trained on datasets of unprecedented size, hence have a catalytic impact towards precision/personalized medicine. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of computer software and hardware technologies, more and more healthcare data are becoming readily available from clinical institutions, patients, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical industries, among others. This access provides an unprecedented opportunity for data science technologies to derive data-driven insights and improve the quality of care delivery. Healthcare data, however, are usually fragmented and private making it difficult to generate robust results across populations. For example, different hospitals own the electronic health records (EHR) of different patient populations and these records are difficult to share across hospitals because of their sensitive nature. This creates a big barrier for developing effective analytical approaches that are generalizable, which need diverse, “big data.” Federated learning, a mechanism of training a shared global model with a central server while keeping all the sensitive data in local institutions where the data belong, provides great promise to connect the fragmented healthcare data sources with privacy-preservation. The goal of this survey is to provide a review for federated learning technologies, particularly within the biomedical space. In particular, we summarize the general solutions to the statistical challenges, system challenges, and privacy issues in federated learning, and point out the implications and potentials in healthcare.},
