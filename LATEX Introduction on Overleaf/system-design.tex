Code snippets must always be added as a listing, never as a figure or table.
Listing ~\ref{lst:python-program} shows a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given
number.


\begin{listing}[h]
\begin{minted}{python}
#Calculate and print the factorial of n
n = int(input('Type a number: '))
if n < 0:
raise ValueError('You must enter a positive integer')
factorial = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
factorial *= i
print(factorial)
\end{minted}
\caption{ Example of a Python program that reads a typed number, then calculates and prints its factorial.}
